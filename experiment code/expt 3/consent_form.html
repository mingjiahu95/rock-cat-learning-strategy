    <h1>INDIANA UNIVERSITY STUDY INFORMATION SHEET FOR RESEARCH</h1>

    <h2>Study title: Perceptual learning strategy</h2>

    <p class="main-text">You are being asked to participate in a research study. Scientists do research to answer
        important questions that
        might help change or improve the way we do things in the future. This document will give you information about
        the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this form and ask any questions you
        have before agreeing to be in the study.</p>

    <p class="main-text">All research is voluntary. You can choose not to take part in this study. If you decide to
        participate, you can
        change your mind later and leave the study at any time. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits if you
        decide not to participate or choose to leave the study later. This research is intended for individuals 18 years
        of age or older. If you are under age 18, do not complete the survey.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
    <p class="main-text">The purpose of this study is to investigate how different learning/teaching methods help people
        learn
        natural-science categories. The study is being conducted by Robert Nosofsky of the Department of Psychological
        and Brain Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington.</p>

    <h3>Study Procedures</h3>
    <p class="main-text">If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things: You will be using a computer
        to make various
        judgments about objects, such as grouping them into categories, judging how similar they are to one another, or
        trying to remember them. The experiment will last between 30-60 minutes. After you finish the computer
        experiment, you will complete a short survey about your learning style. If this is a multiple-session
        experiment, you will have the option of returning for additional sessions.</p>

    <h3>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h3>
    <p class="main-text">Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part
        in this study.
        You may be uncomfortable while answering the survey questions. If there are any questions that make you
        uncomfortable or that you do not want to answer, please notify the experimenter, and you may skip these
        questions. There is a risk that someone outside the study team could get access to your research information
        from this study. More information about how we will protect your information to reduce this risk is below.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p class="main-text">We don&rsquo;t think you will have any personal benefits from taking part in this study, but we
        hope to learn
        things that will help researchers in the future.</p>

    <h3>Compensation</h3>
    <p class="main-text">You will be paid for participating in this study. You will be compensated $8.00 for
        participating in this study,
        with a possible $4.00 bonus for good performance.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <p class="main-text">We will protect your information and make every effort to keep your personal information
        confidential, but we
        cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. No information which could identify you will be shared in
        publications about this study. Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by
        law. We may also need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis.
        These groups include the Indiana University Institutional Review Board or its designees and state or federal
        agencies who may need to access the research records (as allowed by law).</p>
