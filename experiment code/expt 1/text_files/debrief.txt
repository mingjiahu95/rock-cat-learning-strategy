Thank you for participating in our experiment.\n\n\nOne of the major goals in introductory college-level science classes is to teach students the major categories in the domain of study.  In the present example, we are interested in the teaching of rock categories in the geologic sciences.\n\n\nAn important issue is whether students learn more effectively if teachers provide the examples of the categories that need to be learned or if students choose the examples on their own.\n\n\nDepending on which condition you were randomly assigned to, you received either teacher-chosen examples or you chose the examples on your own.  The results of this experiment will provide important information about which teaching method is more effective.
