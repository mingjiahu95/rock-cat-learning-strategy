Welcome!\n\nThank you for participating in our experiment!
In this experiment you will learn to\nidentify 8 different kinds of rocks,\nlike obsidian, pumice, etc.
On each trial, you will start by seeing\na grid of rocks, like below.
Then you will see an enlarged picture of the rock, with\nbuttons on the screen with the different types, like below.
Make your best guess at identifying the rock by clicking one\nof the buttons. After you make your selection, the computer\nwill tell you the correct answer.
At first you will be guessing, but by paying\nattention to the rocks and the correct answers\nprovided by the computer, you should gradually\nlearn to classify rocks.
After each of the training blocks that we\njust described, you will be tested on\nwhat you have learned in a test block. We will\nexplain the test blocks after you complete\nyour first training block.\n\nThe experiment consists of 9 cycles of\ntraining and test blocks,\nwith 16 trials per each block.
Your goal is to learn to correctly classify the\nrocks into as many of the 8 types\nas you can during the TEST blocks.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, you should ask\nthe experimenter now.
