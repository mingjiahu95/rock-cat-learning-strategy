You will now start the first test block of the experiment.\n\nDuring the test, you will be classifiying rocks\ninto the same 8 categories as before.\n\nHowever, you will be seeing new rocks from\neach of the 8 categories. 
On each trial, the computer will display a\nsingle rock on the screen, along with the buttons.\n\nAs before, make your best guess of which category the rock\nbelongs to by clicking one of the buttons.\n\nIn the test block, the computer will not\ntell you whether your answer was correct.\n\nInstead, the computer will just say 'Okay' to\nlet you know it recorded your response.\n\nHowever, the computer will tell you your overall percent\ncorrect at the end of each test block.
Your goal is to learn to correctly classify the\nrocks into as many of the 8 categories\nas you can during these TEST blocks.\n\nEach test block has 16 trials.
